# Appliance Ant

AI operations platform for **TN Appliance Exchange LLC**. Owner: James "Teddy" Pivacek (tech ID 1, `tnappliancerepair@gmail.com`, SMS **615-485-5795** for human-judgment escalations).

## First — read this before doing anything

Every new session: read this whole file, then in your first reply report (a) **what's built**, (b) **what's next**, and (c) **what NOT to do**. The "Working rules" section below is load-bearing — violating it once costs more than re-reading it ten times.

## Infrastructure

- **Xano API base:** `https://xbtp-g9bh-ditq.n7e.xano.io/api:3e_TffpA`
- **Netlify site:** `superlative-naiad-233aa7.netlify.app`
- **Metadata API base:** `https://xbtp-g9bh-ditq.n7e.xano.io/api:meta/workspace/1` (bearer auth via `XANO_METADATA_TOKEN`)

## Agent platform

- **17 live agents** today; building toward **379 agents across 20 colonies**.
- **New agents go into the Mac Mini colony loop as functions — not Xano endpoints.** See the "Architecture" and Working rule 5 sections.
- **Legacy path (existing agents only):** `agent_proposals` → human approve → `agent_builder` → `agent_queue`. See `agent-proposals.html` (Build It button) and `xano-workspace/api/intake/agent_builder_POST.xs`. Do not extend this pipeline for new agents.
- **`colony_signals` table** (Xano table id 38, created 2026-05-24): inter-colony messaging substrate the Mac Mini loop polls. Columns: `signal_type` (req), `signal_strength` (int, req), `source_colony`, `target_colonies` (comma-separated, empty = broadcast), `payload` (JSON-encoded string), `processed_at` (NULL = pending), `created_at` (auto).

## Architecture: Mac Mini / colony loop (decided 2026-05-24)

- **Mac Mini runs the colony loop 24/7.** The local Mac Mini is the runtime for every agent, polling `colony_signals` / `agent_queue` and dispatching work.
- **New agents are functions inside the loop — never Xano endpoints, never Xano background tasks.** Adding an agent = adding a function (Python/JS) to the Mac Mini loop codebase. Do not build new XS endpoints for agent logic; the `agent_builder → Xano endpoint` pipeline is the OLD path, retained only for legacy agents already on `agent_queue`.
- **Xano = persistence + state.** Tables (`colony_signals`, `agent_proposals`, `agent_queue`, `event_log`, etc.), Metadata API for CRUD, and webhook endpoints for inbound events. No execution-loop logic.
- **Netlify = browser-facing only.** Static pages + proxy functions for the dashboard. No long-running logic.
- **Why:**
  - **Xano task limit hit:** ceiling of 10 scheduled tasks per workspace. We are already at it; can't add more agents as Xano crons.
  - **`agent_builder` fought parser errors for 3 days:** XS's hard rules (em-dashes, fences, `??`/`|trim` in `if`) keep biting any code-generation pipeline that emits XS server-side.
  - **Mac Mini runs 24/7 with no limits:** unbounded number of loop functions, no task-count ceiling, no XS parser between us and execution.
  - **Claude Code can write and deploy new agent functions itself:** the loop's source lives in a repo Claude Code has full write access to; no UI paste step.
  - **Full audit trail:** every loop tick + dispatch + Claude call writes to `event_log` / `colony_signals`. Nothing happens off-the-record.
  - **Nothing gets lost between sessions:** loop state + CLAUDE.md + memory persist across restarts; the Mac Mini is the durable "always-on" we never had with browser-tab sessions.

## Long-term vision (the job flow we're automating toward)

Every appliance-repair job, end-to-end, should flow through these five steps automatically — humans only intervene where judgment is required:

1. **Pre-diagnosis** — symptoms collected, likely failure modes identified, before the truck rolls.
2. **Parts ordered before arrival** — the diagnosis triggers the order so the tech shows up with the part already on the truck (or staged for the next visit).
3. **Waiver signed before tech arrives** — customer e-signs liability/scope-of-work paperwork ahead of the appointment, not at the door.
4. **Tech Assist guides the job** — on-site, the tech is walked through diagnosis/repair steps by the assist agent rather than going to YouTube.
5. **Danielle submits warranty immediately after** — warranty paperwork goes out the moment the job closes, not in a Friday batch.

Every architectural decision should move at least one of these five steps closer to "happens with zero human prompting." If a proposed change doesn't, ask why we're doing it.

## Session commands

- **Start of session:** Read `CLAUDE.md` and report **what's built, what's next, and what NOT to do**.
- **End of session:** Update `CLAUDE.md` with **what was built today**, then **commit and push to GitHub**.

## Working rules

1. **Check what exists before building anything.** Before creating a new table, endpoint, Netlify function, loop function, or doc, list the relevant namespace (`/api:meta/workspace/1/table`, `xano-workspace/api/`, the Mac Mini loop repo, this repo) and grep by keyword. Today's `colony_signals` create only happened after confirming no `colony*`/`signal*` table existed — apply that same check every time.
2. **Claude and Mac Mini first; touch Xano or Netlify UI manually only when scripted paths have failed.** Default order: Claude → Metadata API → Mac Mini loop function → Xano UI / Netlify dashboard. UI clicks bypass the audit trail and break the build-by-agent pipeline — treat them as last-resort.
3. **Automate everything.** If a task needs no human judgment, fully automate it. If it needs human judgment, automate up to the decision point then **SMS Teddy at 615-485-5795** with the choices and wait for `approve` / `reject`. Never leave a manual step in the loop where an SMS prompt would do.
4. **Take the most efficient path unless it hurts the long-term vision.** Default to the shortest implementation that works. Only spend extra effort when a quick fix would move the system *away* from the five-step vision above (pre-diagnosis → parts → waiver → tech-assist → warranty). If a shortcut is vision-neutral, take it.
5. **New agents = Mac Mini loop functions, NOT Xano endpoints/tasks.** Restating Architecture rule because it's the most-violated default. If you catch yourself opening `agent_builder` to add a *new* agent, stop — add a function to the Mac Mini loop instead. `agent_builder` is only for legacy upkeep.
6. **Start every session by reading this file.** Then in the first reply: report (a) **what's built**, (b) **what's next**, (c) **what NOT to do**. Skipping this is how stale assumptions creep back in.

## XanoScript rules (fast reference)

Full catalog: `docs/xanoscript-footguns.md`. The hard rules:

- **No em-dashes** anywhere — parser crashes.
- **No try/catch** — XS has no exception handling. `db.get` on null PK / `json_decode` on bad input throw `ERROR_FATAL` and kill the script.
- **No backtick template literals** — use double-quoted strings joined with `~`.
- **`data = { ... }`** for `db.add` and `db.edit` (not `fields =`). Field name is `metadata` (a JSON column) on `event_log`.
- **`??` and `|trim` only inside `value = (...)` assignments** — the UI parse-serialize round-trip silently strips them inside `if(...)` comparisons.
- **Array index:** `|get:N` with literal integer (40+ proven usages). Object key: `|get:$str_var`.
- **First row of paginated query:** `($rows|first ?? null)`. Paginated `db.query` returns `{items: [...]}`, not the array directly.
- **Anthropic response path:** `$resp.response.result.content[0].text` — memorize. Partial paths produce silent empty strings.
- **Strip Sonnet 4.5 markdown fences before `json_decode`:** `($raw|replace:"\`\`\`json":""|replace:"\`\`\`":"")|trim` — `|trim` is mandatory; without it `json_decode` throws on residual whitespace.

## Session log — 2026-05-24

### What was built today

**Architecture pivot to Mac Mini colony loop (decided 2026-05-24).** Documented in CLAUDE.md "Architecture" section. The "why" is captured: Xano's 10-task ceiling, agent_builder XS parser fights, Mac Mini 24/7 with no limits, Claude Code writes + deploys functions itself, full audit trail.

**New table:** `colony_signals` (Xano id 38). Schema in `CLAUDE.md` Agent platform bullet. Holds the inter-colony messaging substrate the loop polls.

**Design doc:** `docs/colony-loop-design.md` (17 sections, all open questions answered). The §17 answers + §16 Phase A/B/C build plan are the canonical reference.

**Colony loop Phase A — code complete, awaiting paste + run** (`colony-loop/` subdirectory, ~1100 LOC, zero npm dependencies):
- 5 XanoScript support endpoints (`colony-loop/xano-endpoints/intake/`): `get_pending_colony_signals_GET`, `mark_signal_processed_POST`, `emit_colony_signal_POST`, `get_daily_briefing_fired_today_GET`, `get_greeting_sent_for_job_GET`. All scanned clean for em-dash / backtick / try-catch / `??`-in-`if` footguns.
- Node 20+ loop runtime: `index.js`, `tick.js`, `dispatch.js`, `xano.js`, `claude.js` (Sonnet 4.6 vision-capable, prompt-cached system block), `sms.js`, `escalate.js`, `time.js` (America/Chicago via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`), `config.js` (env + `.env` parser).
- 4 agents matching signal_type=filename convention: `daily_briefing`, `payroll_calculator`, `job_created` (the universal greeting trigger), `customer_intake_reply` (Claude pre-diagnosis with image inputs).
- Tooling: `scripts/smoke-test.js`, `scripts/inject-signal.js`, `launchd/com.tnappliance.colony-loop.plist`, `rules/commission_rules.json`, `prompts/pre_diagnosis.md`, `README.md` with full deploy + verify steps.

**Footgun catalog update:** `docs/xanoscript-footguns.md` now documents that the Metadata API column-add endpoint is `/schema/type/{type}` — three plausible alternatives (`/schema/{type}`, `/column`, `PUT /schema`) all 404 or reject.

### Current priority — **TEST PHASE A**

Nothing else gets built until Phase A is verified end-to-end. Order of operations:

1. **Paste the 5 XS files** into Xano UI (intake group). All 5 must return 200 OK on `npm run smoke` from `colony-loop/`.
2. **Smoke test in DRY_RUN mode**: inject a fake `JOB_CREATED` signal with Teddy's own phone, watch stdout for `signal_dispatched` → `signal_processed`.
3. **Flip DRY_RUN=false**, re-inject, confirm an actual SMS lands on +16154855795.
4. **Deploy to Mac Mini** via launchd plist, verify the heartbeat in `~/Library/Logs/colony-loop.out.log`.
5. **Only then** start Phase B (wiring `JOB_CREATED` emit into the 6 producer XS endpoints — see `docs/colony-loop-design.md` §16 Phase B).

### What NOT to do

- **Do NOT touch the 6 producer XS endpoints yet** (`hcp_job_webhook`, `hcp_poll_recent_jobs`, `ahs_email_intake`, `servicepower_email_intake`, `create_job_from_chat`, `warranty_job_intake`, `save_attachment`). Phase B work — explicitly deferred until Phase A passes its smoke test.
- **Do NOT auto-fire pre-diagnosis SMS at the 50 stale `prediagnosis_pending` jobs** from 2026-05-20. Per Q8: handle them manually in Teddy Tool.
- **Do NOT harden `agent_builder` for new agents.** Per the Mac Mini pivot it's deprecated for new work; legacy path only.
- **Do NOT ship `JOB_CREATED` greetings during quiet hours** (before 8am / after 9pm CT). The agent holds-and-re-emits — don't bypass.

### Still open (logged in `docs/colony-loop-design.md`)

- `countCompletedPreDiagnoses()` in `customer_intake_reply.js` is a stub returning 0 — intentionally keeps the first-20-always-escalate window permanent until after first live shake-down.
- Customer-SMS inbound webhook not assumed; CUSTOMER_INTAKE_REPLY fires only via media upload (Q11).
- `agent_builder` 500 still open as legacy-cleanup concern — `|trim` fix is in, but Claude-emitted XS still trips the Metadata API parser. Diagnostic path: pull most-recent `agent_builder_create_result` row from `event_log`. Low priority per pivot.

## Where to look
